## Description

This plugin uses the Google My Business API which allows it to retrieve all reviews instead of the only five reviews that can be retrieved using the Google Places API. When the plugin has access to the API, the plugin inserts structured data into the footer of the website. This results in a rating in the Google search results.

The plugin also allows you to display your rating with a standard widget or shortcode. You can use this anywhere in your theme or builder.

**Extra features for Premium users:**  
1 A variety of default shortcodes that give you the flexibility to show the rating in the way you want.  
2 Functionality to create your own widget!  
3 Functionality to style your own or our default widget / shortcodes.  
4 Interact with the reviews. Read and reply to reviews!  

**Extra features for Premium users that use WooCommerce:**
1 Functionality to create an invitation e-mail.  
2 Functionality to send your custom e-mail to customers.
